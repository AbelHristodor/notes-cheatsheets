# Introduction
High-level overview of the infrastructure.

## Cluster Architecture
The purpose of k8s is to host applications as containers easily and enable communication between them.
There are two kinds of nodes:
- **worker nodes**: Host applications as containers
- **master nodes**: Manage, plan, schedule and monitor nodes

### Master Node (Control Plane)
- **ETCD** is a key-value store (database) containing all the necessary configuration and information about the cluster.
- **Kube Scheduler** identifies the right node to schedule a container based on its resources requirements, and worker node resources, taints, affinities etc..
- **Kube Controller-Manager**:
	- **Node-Controller**: Takes care of nodes, onboarding new nodes, deletes them
	- **Replication-Controller**: Makes sure the required number of instances are running
	- **etc...**
- **Kube APIServer**: Responsible of orchestrating operations in the cluster. Exposes the k8s API and monitors the state of other controller in order to manage the cluster.

- *Container Runtime*: Docker 

### Worker Nodes
- **Kubelet**: agent that runs on each node and listens for instructions from the api-server. 
- **kube-proxy**: service that enables communication between containers

# ETCD
*In general* etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store that is simple, fast and secure.
A *key-value* store stores information in the form of documents or pages written in JSON or YAML
You can download the etcd service and use it as a database. It has a *control client* used it to interact with etcd on port 2379 like `etcdctl set/put key1 value1` or `etcdctl get key1`, command depend on the version of etcd and is api-version.

## ETCD in Kubernetes
It sores information about the cluster for Nodes, Pods, Configs, Secrets etc..
Every change you make to the cluster is stored in the etcd. Only when the change is made in the etcd it is considered as complete and then executed in the cluster.
K8s stores data in a specific directory structure. The *root* is */registry/* and the data is stored in its own directory. E.g. */registry/nodes* etc.

In a HA environment, the etcd instances must know about each other. During the setup of the master etcd it is crucial to set up the other etcd instances.


# Kube API-Server
The commands that kubectl executes reach the apiserver which first authenticates and validates the request. Then it gets the data and returns the response. You could only use the api-server directly.
E.g. you can create a pod by making a post request:
**The API Server is responsible for **
1. *Authentication* - request gets authenticated
2. *Validation* - request gets validated
3. *Retrieve* - data is retrieved, the api creates a pod without assigning it to a *node* and the user is alerted that the pod is being created.
4. *Update Etcd* - the etcd gets updated
5. *Scheduler* - The Scheduler monitors the api-server and realizes there's a new pod. It identifies the appropriate node and tells it to the api-server which updates the information in the etcd. 
6. *Kubelet* - The api-server passes that information to the kubelet which then creates the pod on the node and instructs the container runtime to deploy the defined image. Then the kubelet announces the api-server which updates the data in the etcd.
