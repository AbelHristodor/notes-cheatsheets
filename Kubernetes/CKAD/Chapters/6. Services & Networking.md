# Services
Services enable connectivity between groups of pods, pods to users and pods to external services.
## External Communication
How can we access a pod into the cluster from outside without ssh-ing into the node?
We use a *service* object that can forward ports from inside the node to the pod. This is a **NodePort**. 

### Service Types
- **NodePort**: forwards a port from the node to the pod
- **ClusterIP**: creates a virtual IP inside the cluster to allow communication between services
- **LoadBalancer**: deploys a loadbalancer to distribute load

### NodePort
![[NodePort.png]]
There are 3 involved port:
1. **TargetPort**: The port on the pod
2. **Port**: the port on the service
3. **NodePort**: the port on the node, it can be in the range 30000-32767

Let's see a definition:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
	name: myapp-service
spec:
	selectors:
		<my-label>: <my_label_value> // This selects the pod/deployment
	type: NodePort
	ports:
	- targetPort: 80
	  port: 80
	  nodePort: 30008
```
The only required port is the **port: 80** field. The `targetPort` if not defined will be defaulted to the `ports`'s value while the `nodePort` will be randomly picked from the free ones.

Note that you can map multiple ports.

### ClusterIP
Enable internal pod-to-pod (deploy-to-deploy) communication by allocating an internal IP. It allows to access pods in a group.

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
	name: myapp-service
spec:
	selectors:
		<my-label>: <my_label_value> // This selects the pod/deployment
	type: ClusterIP // Default type - not mandatory
	ports:
	- targetPort: 80 // Container port
	  port: 80 // External port
```

You can use the clusterIp's IP or clusterip's name to connect services together.

### Ingress
![[Ingress.png]]
Ingresses are used to securely expose an application to the web by using load balancers provided by the cloud platform the cluster is hosted onto. It allows various configuration such as **path** mappings, **tls** and others. It requires an **Ingress controller** to be deployed onto the cluster (E.g. GCP's ingress, Traefik, Nginx Ingress Controller).

## Network Policies
Allows to define some rules applied to pods to allow or deny traffic to it from/to specific ips and ports.
![[IngressEgress.png]]
**Egress**: Traffic going out
**Ingress**: Traffic coming into

Example for an ingress policy. What isn't defined it isn't blocked.
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
	name: db-policy
spec:
	podSelector:
		matchLabels:
			role: db
	policyTypes:
	 - Ingress
	ingress:
	 - from:
	   - podSelector:
	       matchLabels:
	        name: api-pod
	   ports:
	   - protocol: TCP
	     port: 3306
```
