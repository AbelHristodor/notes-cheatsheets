# Authentication
Authentication is used to check who can access the cluster. There are different types of *cluster users* (aka entities who want to access the cluster):
- **Admins**
- **Developers**
- **End Users**
- **Bots/Other external applications**
So we can split the user types in two: *human* (users) and *bots* (service accounts).
Kubernetes does not manage user accounts directly however it can handle service accounts.

## Users
All user access is managed by the *kube-apiserver*, whether you use `kubectl` or you do an http request, everything goes through the `apiserver`, which *authenticates* the request before processing it.

The **kube-apiserver** uses many different to authenticate:
1. *static password file*: use a csv file with `password, username, userId, group` as columns and pass that to the *apiserver* by using `--basic-auth-file=file.csv`
2. *static token file*: similar to the previous but it uses tokens instead of passwords. Csv file contains `token, username, userId, group` and gets passed to the *apiserver* with `--token-auth-file`. This way you can make http requests and pass the bearer `token` as an `Authorization` header.
**Those are not recommended for obvious security reasons**
