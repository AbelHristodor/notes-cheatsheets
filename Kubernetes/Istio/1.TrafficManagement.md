# General
Istio lets you set up traffic rules to **control** the **flow of traffic** and API calls between services.
Traffic management model relies on the *Envoy* proxies deployed on your services since all traffic that your mesh services send and receive is *proxied* through Envoy.

## Introduction
First of all, Istio needs to discover all you endpoints and which services they belong to, so, in order to populate its *service registry*, Istio connects to a **service discovery system.**  
Thanks to this service registry *Envoy* proxies can direct traffic to relevant services, using by default a **least request model** i.e. sends the requests to the service with the *fewer active requests*, so the most heavily loaded hosts will not receive requests until it is no more loaded than any other host. 

Like other Istio configuration, the API is specified using Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs), which you can configure using YAML.

The resources the Istio API exposes are the following:
- [[#Virtual Services]]
- [[#Destination Rules]]
- [[#Gateways]]
- [[#Service Entries]]
- [[#Sidecars]]

## Virtual Services
Lets you configure *how requests are routed to a service* within an Istio service mesh. Each VS consists of a **set of routing rules** evaluated in order, letting istio match each request to the VS to a specific real destination within the mesh. You can have *none to many*, depending on your use-case.

## Destination Rules

## Gateways

## Service Entries
