# 2.Security
Security in Istio involves multiple components:
- A **Certificate Authority (CA)** for key and certificate management
- The configuration API server distributes to the proxies:
	- *authentication policies*
	- *authorization policies*
	- *secure naming information*
- Sidecar and perimeter proxies work as **Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs)** to secure communication between clients and servers.
- A set of Envoy proxy extensions to manage **telemetry and auditing**

![[IstioMersh.png]]
## [Istio identity](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#istio-identity)
Identity is a fundamental concept of any security infrastructure. At the beginning of a workload-to-workload communication, the two parties must **exchange credentials** with their identity information for **mutual authentication** purposes. On the client side, the server’s identity is checked against the [secure naming](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#secure-naming) information to see if it is an authorized runner of the workload. On the server side, the server can determine what information the client can access based on the [authorization policies](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#authorization-policies), audit who accessed what at what time, charge clients based on the workloads they used, and reject any clients who failed to pay their bill from accessing the workloads.

The Istio identity model uses the first-class `service identity` to determine the identity of a request’s origin. This model allows for **great flexibility** and granularity for service identities to represent a human user, an individual workload, or a group of workloads. 

The following list shows examples of service identities that you can use on different platforms:

- Kubernetes: Kubernetes service account
- GCE: GCP service account
- On-premises (non-Kubernetes): user account, custom service account, service name, Istio service account, or GCP service account. 
## [Identity and certificate management](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#pki)
Istio securely provisions strong identities to every workload with **X.509 certificates**. Istio agents, running alongside each Envoy proxy, work together with `istiod` to automate key and certificate rotation at scale. The following diagram shows the identity provisioning flow.

![[IstioCerts.png]]

Istio provisions keys and certificates through the following flow:
1. `istiod` offers a gRPC service to take **certificate signing requests (CSRs)**.
2. When started, the Istio agent creates the private key and CSR, and then sends the CSR with its credentials to `istiod` for signing.
3. The CA in istiod **validates** the credentials carried in the CSR. Upon successful validation, it signs the CSR to generate the certificate.
4. When a workload is started, Envoy requests the certificate and key from the Istio agent in the same container via the **Envoy secret discovery service (SDS)** API.
5. The Istio agent sends the certificates received from istiod and the private key to Envoy via the Envoy SDS API.
6. Istio agent monitors the expiration of the workload certificate. The above process repeats periodically for certificate and key rotation.

## Authentication
Istio provides two types of authentication:
- **Peer authentication**: used for *service-to-service authentication* to verify the client making the connection. Istio offers [mutual TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication) as a full stack solution for transport authentication, which can be enabled without requiring service code changes. This solution:
    - Provides each service with a **strong identity** representing its role to enable interoperability across clusters and clouds.
    - **Secures** service-to-service **communication**.
    - Provides a **key management system** to automate key and certificate generation, distribution, and rotation.
- **Request authentication**: Used for end-user authentication to verify the credential attached to the request. Istio enables request-level authentication with JSON Web Token (JWT) validation and a streamlined developer experience using a custom authentication provider or any OpenID Connect providers, for example:
    - [ORY Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/)
    - [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)
    - [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)
    - [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/)
    - [Google Auth](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect)

In all cases, Istio stores the **authentication policies** in the `Istio config store` via a custom Kubernetes API. `Istiod` keeps them up-to-date for each proxy, along with the keys where appropriate. Additionally, Istio supports authentication in permissive mode to help you understand how a policy change can affect your security posture before it is enforced.

### [Mutual TLS authentication](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#mutual-tls-authentication)
Istio tunnels service-to-service communication through the client- and server-side *PEPs*, which are implemented as [Envoy proxies](https://www.envoyproxy.io/). When a workload sends a request to another workload using mutual TLS authentication, the request is handled as follows:

1. Istio re-routes the outbound traffic from a client to the *client’s local sidecar* Envoy.
2. The client side Envoy starts a **mutual TLS handshake** with the server side Envoy. During the handshake, the client side Envoy also does a [secure naming](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#secure-naming) check to verify that the service account presented in the server certificate is authorized to run the target service.
3. The client side Envoy and the server side Envoy establish a mutual TLS connection, and Istio forwards the traffic from the client side Envoy to the server side Envoy.
4. The server side Envoy authorizes the request. If authorized, it forwards the traffic to the backend service through local TCP connections.

Istio configures `TLSv1_2` as the minimum TLS version for both client and server with the following cipher suites:
- `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`
- `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`
- `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`
- `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`
- `AES256-GCM-SHA384`
- `AES128-GCM-SHA256`
#### [Permissive mode](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#permissive-mode)
Istio mutual TLS has a **permissive mode**, which allows a service to accept both **plaintext** traffic and **mutual TLS** traffic at the same time. This feature greatly improves the mutual TLS onboarding experience.

#### [Secure naming](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#secure-naming)
**Server identities** are encoded in **certificates**, but service names are retrieved through the **discovery service** or **DNS**. The secure naming information maps the server identities to the service names. A mapping of identity `A` to service name `B` means “`A` is authorized to run service `B`”. The control plane watches the `apiserver`, generates the secure naming mappings, and distributes them securely to the PEPs.


### [Authentication architecture](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#authentication-architecture)
You can specify authentication requirements for workloads receiving requests in an Istio mesh using **peer and request authentication policies**. The mesh operator uses `.yaml` files to specify the policies. The policies are saved in the Istio configuration storage once deployed. The Istio controller watches the configuration storage.

Upon any policy changes, the new policy is translated to the appropriate configuration telling the PEP how to perform the required authentication mechanisms. The control plane may fetch the public key and attach it to the configuration for JWT validation. Alternatively, Istiod provides the path to the keys and certificates the Istio system manages and installs them to the application pod for mutual TLS. You can find more info in the [Identity and certificate management section](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#pki).

Istio sends configurations to the targeted endpoints **asynchronously**. Once the proxy receives the configuration, the new authentication requirement takes effect immediately on that pod.

Client services, those that send requests, are responsible for following the necessary authentication mechanism. For request authentication, the application is responsible for acquiring and attaching the JWT credential to the request. For peer authentication, Istio automatically upgrades all traffic between two PEPs to mutual TLS. If authentication policies disable mutual TLS mode, Istio continues to use plain text between PEPs. To override this behavior explicitly disable mutual TLS mode with [destination rules](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#destination-rules). You can find out more about how mutual TLS works in the [Mutual TLS authentication section](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#mutual-tls-authentication).
![[IstioAuthArch.png]]

### [Authentication policies](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#authentication-policies)
This section provides more details about how Istio authentication policies work. Authentication policies apply to requests that a service receives. To specify client-side authentication rules in **mutual TLS**, you need to specify the `TLSSettings` in the `DestinationRule`. You can find more information in our [TLS settings reference docs](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/destination-rule#ClientTLSSettings).

You deploy policies using `kubectl`. The following example authentication policy specifies that transport authentication for the workloads with the `app:reviews` label must use mutual TLS:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: "example-peer-policy"
  namespace: "foo"
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: reviews
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

#### [Policy storage](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#policy-storage)
Istio stores **mesh-scope policies** in the root namespace. These policies have an empty selector apply to all workloads in the mesh. Policies that have a namespace scope are stored in the corresponding namespace. They only apply to workloads within their namespace. If you configure a `selector` field, the authentication policy only applies to workloads matching the conditions you configured.

Peer and request authentication policies are stored separately by kind, `PeerAuthentication` and `RequestAuthentication` respectively.

#### [Selector field](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#selector-field)
Peer and request authentication policies use `selector` fields to specify the label of the workloads to which the **policy applies.** The following example shows the selector field of a policy that applies to workloads with the `app:product-page` label:

```yaml
selector:
  matchLabels:
    app: product-page
```

If you don’t provide a value for the `selector` field, Istio matches the policy to all workloads in the storage scope of the policy. Thus, the `selector` fields help you specify the scope of the policies:

- Mesh-wide policy: A policy specified for the root namespace without or with an empty `selector` field.
- Namespace-wide policy: A policy specified for a non-root namespace without or with an empty `selector` field.
- Workload-specific policy: a policy defined in the regular namespace, with non-empty selector field.

Peer and request authentication policies follow the same hierarchy principles for the `selector` fields, but Istio combines and applies them in slightly different ways

#### [Peer authentication](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#peer-authentication)
Peer authentication policies specify the **mutual TLS mode** Istio enforces on target workloads. The following modes are supported:

- **PERMISSIVE**: Workloads accept both mutual TLS and plain text traffic. This mode is most useful during migrations when workloads without sidecar cannot use mutual TLS. Once workloads are migrated with sidecar injection, you should switch the mode to STRICT.
- **STRICT**: Workloads only accept mutual TLS traffic.
- **DISABLE**: Mutual TLS is disabled. From a security perspective, you shouldn’t use this mode unless you provide your own security solution.

When the mode is unset, the mode of the parent scope is inherited. Mesh-wide peer authentication policies with an unset mode use the `PERMISSIVE` mode by default.
The following peer authentication policy requires all workloads in namespace `foo` to use mutual TLS:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: "example-policy"
  namespace: "foo"
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

With workload-specific peer authentication policies, you can specify **different mutual TLS modes for different ports**. You can only use ports that workloads have claimed for port-wide mutual TLS configuration. The following example disables mutual TLS on port `80` for the `app:example-app` workload, and uses the mutual TLS settings of the namespace-wide peer authentication policy for all other ports:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: "example-workload-policy"
  namespace: "foo"
spec:
  selector:
     matchLabels:
       app: example-app
  portLevelMtls:
    80:
      mode: DISABLE
```

## Authorization
Istio’s authorization features provide mesh-, namespace-, and workload-wide access control for your workloads in the mesh. This level of control provides the following benefits:

- Workload-to-workload and end-user-to-workload authorization.
- A simple API: it includes a single [`AuthorizationPolicy` CRD](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/authorization-policy/), which is easy to use and maintain.
- Flexible semantics: operators can define custom conditions on Istio attributes, and use CUSTOM, DENY and ALLOW actions.
- High performance: Istio authorization (`ALLOW` and `DENY`) is enforced natively on Envoy.
- High compatibility: supports gRPC, HTTP, HTTPS and HTTP/2 natively, as well as any plain TCP protocols.

### [Authorization architecture](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#authorization-architecture)

The authorization policy enforces access control to the inbound traffic in the server side Envoy proxy. Each Envoy proxy runs an authorization engine that authorizes requests at runtime. When a request comes to the proxy, the authorization engine evaluates the request context against the current authorization policies, and returns the authorization result, either `ALLOW` or `DENY`. Operators specify Istio authorization policies using `.yaml` files.

[![Authorization Architecture](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/authz.svg)](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/authz.svg "Authorization Architecture")

Authorization Architecture

### [Implicit enablement](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#implicit-enablement)

You don’t need to explicitly enable Istio’s authorization features; they are available after installation. To enforce access control to your workloads, you apply an authorization policy.

For workloads without authorization policies applied, Istio allows all requests.

Authorization policies support `ALLOW`, `DENY` and `CUSTOM` actions. You can apply multiple policies, each with a different action, as needed to secure access to your workloads.

Istio checks for matching policies in layers, in this order: `CUSTOM`, `DENY`, and then `ALLOW`. For each type of action, Istio first checks if there is a policy with the action applied, and then checks if the request matches the policy’s specification. If a request doesn’t match a policy in one of the layers, the check continues to the next layer.

The following graph shows the policy precedence in detail:

[![Authorization Policy Precedence](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/authz-eval.svg)](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/authz-eval.svg "Authorization Policy Precedence")

**Authorization Policy Precedence**
When you apply multiple authorization policies to the same workload, Istio applies them additively.

### [Authorization policies](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#authorization-policies)

To configure an authorization policy, you create an [`AuthorizationPolicy` custom resource](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/authorization-policy/). An authorization policy includes a selector, an action, and a list of rules:

- The `selector` field specifies the target of the policy
- The `action` field specifies whether to allow or deny the request
- The `rules` specify when to trigger the action
    - The `from` field in the `rules` specifies the sources of the request
    - The `to` field in the `rules` specifies the operations of the request
    - The `when` field specifies the conditions needed to apply the rule

The following example shows an authorization policy that allows two sources, the `cluster.local/ns/default/sa/sleep` service account and the `dev` namespace, to access the workloads with the `app: httpbin` and `version: v1` labels in the `foo` namespace when requests sent have a valid JWT token.

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
 name: httpbin
 namespace: foo
spec:
 selector:
   matchLabels:
     app: httpbin
     version: v1
 action: ALLOW
 rules:
 - from:
   - source:
       principals: ["cluster.local/ns/default/sa/sleep"]
   - source:
       namespaces: ["dev"]
   to:
   - operation:
       methods: ["GET"]
   when:
   - key: request.auth.claims[iss]
     values: ["https://accounts.google.com"]
```

The following example shows an authorization policy that denies requests if the source is not the `foo` namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
 name: httpbin-deny
 namespace: foo
spec:
 selector:
   matchLabels:
     app: httpbin
     version: v1
 action: DENY
 rules:
 - from:
   - source:
       notNamespaces: ["foo"]
```

The deny policy takes precedence over the allow policy. Requests matching allow policies can be denied if they match a deny policy. Istio evaluates deny policies first to ensure that an allow policy can’t bypass a deny policy.

#### [Policy Target](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#policy-target)

You can specify a policy’s scope or target with the `metadata/namespace` field and an optional `selector` field. A policy applies to the namespace in the `metadata/namespace` field. If set its value to the root namespace, the policy applies to all namespaces in a mesh. The value of the root namespace is configurable, and the default is `istio-system`. If set to any other namespace, the policy only applies to the specified namespace.

You can use a `selector` field to further restrict policies to apply to specific workloads. The `selector` uses labels to select the target workload. The selector contains a list of `{key: value}` pairs, where the `key` is the name of the label. If not set, the authorization policy applies to all workloads in the same namespace as the authorization policy.

For example, the `allow-read` policy allows `"GET"` and `"HEAD"` access to the workload with the `app: products` label in the `default` namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-read
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: products
  action: ALLOW
  rules:
  - to:
    - operation:
         methods: ["GET", "HEAD"]
```

#### [Value matching](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#value-matching)

Most fields in authorization policies support all the following matching schemas:

- Exact match: exact string match.
- Prefix match: a string with an ending `"*"`. For example, `"test.abc.*"` matches `"test.abc.com"`, `"test.abc.com.cn"`, `"test.abc.org"`, etc.
- Suffix match: a string with a starting `"*"`. For example, `"*.abc.com"` matches `"eng.abc.com"`, `"test.eng.abc.com"`, etc.
- Presence match: `*` is used to specify anything but not empty. To specify that a field must be present, use the `fieldname: ["*"]`format. This is different from leaving a field unspecified, which means match anything, including empty.

There are a few exceptions. For example, the following fields only support exact match:

- The `key` field under the `when` section
- The `ipBlocks` under the `source` section
- The `ports` field under the `to` section

The following example policy allows access at paths with the `/test/*` prefix or the `*/info` suffix.

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: tester
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: products
  action: ALLOW
  rules:
  - to:
    - operation:
        paths: ["/test/*", "*/info"]
```

#### [Exclusion matching](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#exclusion-matching)

To match negative conditions like `notValues` in the `when` field, `notIpBlocks` in the `source` field, `notPorts` in the `to` field, Istio supports exclusion matching. The following example requires a valid request principals, which is derived from JWT authentication, if the request path is not `/healthz`. Thus, the policy excludes requests to the `/healthz` path from the JWT authentication:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: disable-jwt-for-healthz
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: products
  action: ALLOW
  rules:
  - to:
    - operation:
        notPaths: ["/healthz"]
    from:
    - source:
        requestPrincipals: ["*"]
```

The following example denies the request to the `/admin` path for requests without request principals:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: enable-jwt-for-admin
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: products
  action: DENY
  rules:
  - to:
    - operation:
        paths: ["/admin"]
    from:
    - source:
        notRequestPrincipals: ["*"]
```

#### [`allow-nothing`, `deny-all` and `allow-all` policy](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#allow-nothing-deny-all-and-allow-all-policy)

The following example shows an `ALLOW` policy that matches nothing. If there are no other `ALLOW` policies, requests will always be denied because of the “deny by default” behavior.

Note the “deny by default” behavior applies only if the workload has at least one authorization policy with the `ALLOW` action.

It is a good security practice to start with the `allow-nothing` policy and incrementally add more `ALLOW` policies to open more access to the workload.

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-nothing
spec:
  action: ALLOW
  # the rules field is not specified, and the policy will never match.
```

The following example shows a `DENY` policy that explicitly denies all access. It will always deny the request even if there is another `ALLOW` policy allowing the request because the `DENY` policy takes precedence over the `ALLOW` policy. This is useful if you want to temporarily disable all access to the workload.

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all
spec:
  action: DENY
  # the rules field has an empty rule, and the policy will always match.
  rules:
  - {}
```

The following example shows an `ALLOW` policy that allows full access to the workload. It will make other `ALLOW` policies useless as it will always allow the request. It might be useful if you want to temporarily expose full access to the workload. Note the request could still be denied due to `CUSTOM` and `DENY` policies.

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-all
spec:
  action: ALLOW
  # This matches everything.
  rules:
  - {}
```

#### [Custom conditions](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#custom-conditions)

You can also use the `when` section to specify additional conditions. For example, the following `AuthorizationPolicy` definition includes a condition that `request.headers[version]` is either `"v1"` or `"v2"`. In this case, the key is `request.headers[version]`, which is an entry in the Istio attribute `request.headers`, which is a map.

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
 name: httpbin
 namespace: foo
spec:
 selector:
   matchLabels:
     app: httpbin
     version: v1
 action: ALLOW
 rules:
 - from:
   - source:
       principals: ["cluster.local/ns/default/sa/sleep"]
   to:
   - operation:
       methods: ["GET"]
   when:
   - key: request.headers[version]
     values: ["v1", "v2"]
```

The supported `key` values of a condition are listed on the [conditions page](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/conditions/).

#### [Authenticated and unauthenticated identity](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#authenticated-and-unauthenticated-identity)

If you want to make a workload publicly accessible, you need to leave the `source` section empty. This allows sources from all (both authenticated and unauthenticated) users and workloads, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
 name: httpbin
 namespace: foo
spec:
 selector:
   matchLabels:
     app: httpbin
     version: v1
 action: ALLOW
 rules:
 - to:
   - operation:
       methods: ["GET", "POST"]
```

To allow only authenticated users, set `principals` to `"*"` instead, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
 name: httpbin
 namespace: foo
spec:
 selector:
   matchLabels:
     app: httpbin
     version: v1
 action: ALLOW
 rules:
 - from:
   - source:
       principals: ["*"]
   to:
   - operation:
       methods: ["GET", "POST"]
```

### [Using Istio authorization on plain TCP protocols](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#using-istio-authorization-on-plain-tcp-protocols)

Istio authorization supports workloads using any plain TCP protocols, such as MongoDB. In this case, you configure the authorization policy in the same way you did for the HTTP workloads. The difference is that certain fields and conditions are only applicable to HTTP workloads. These fields include:

- The `request_principals` field in the source section of the authorization policy object
- The `hosts`, `methods` and `paths` fields in the operation section of the authorization policy object

The supported conditions are listed in the [conditions page](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/security/conditions/). If you use any HTTP only fields for a TCP workload, Istio will ignore HTTP-only fields in the authorization policy.

Assuming you have a MongoDB service on port `27017`, the following example configures an authorization policy to only allows the `bookinfo-ratings-v2` service in the Istio mesh to access the MongoDB workload.

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: mongodb-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
 selector:
   matchLabels:
     app: mongodb
 action: ALLOW
 rules:
 - from:
   - source:
       principals: ["cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-ratings-v2"]
   to:
   - operation:
       ports: ["27017"]
```

### [Dependency on mutual TLS](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/#dependency-on-mutual-tls)

Istio uses mutual TLS to securely pass some information from the client to the server. Mutual TLS must be enabled before using any of the following fields in the authorization policy:

- the `principals` and `notPrincipals` field under the `source` section
- the `namespaces` and `notNamespaces` field under the `source` section
- the `source.principal` custom condition
- the `source.namespace` custom condition

Note it is strongly recommended to always use these fields with **strict** mutual TLS mode in the `PeerAuthentication` to avoid potential unexpected requests rejection or policy bypass when plain text traffic is used with the permissive mutual TLS mode.

Check the [security advisory](https://istio.io/latest/news/security/istio-security-2021-004) for more details and alternatives if you cannot enable strict mutual TLS mode.
